      <H2><A name="overview"></A>Overview of the AES Development Effort</H2>
      <I>February 2001</I> 
      <P>

The <A HREF="http://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</A> has been working with industry and the cryptographic community to develop an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).  The overall goal is to develop a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) that specifies an encryption algorithm(s) capable of protecting sensitive government information well into the next century.  The algorithm(s) is expected to be used by the U.S. Government and, on a voluntary basis, by the private sector.<P>

On January 2, 1997, NIST announced the <A HREF="pre-round1/aes_9701.txt">initiation of the AES development effort</A> and made a formal  <A HREF="pre-round1/aes_9709.htm">call for algorithms</A> on September 12, 1997.  The call stipulated that the AES would specify an unclassified, publicly disclosed encryption algorithm(s), available royalty-free, worldwide.   In addition, the algorithm(s) must implement symmetric key cryptography as a block cipher and (at a minimum) support block sizes of 128-bits and key sizes of 128-, 192-, and 256-bits.<P>

On August 20, 1998, NIST announced a group of <A HREF="round1/round1.htm#algorithms">fifteen AES candidate algorithms</A> at the <A HREF="round1/conf1/aes1conf.htm">First AES Candidate Conference (AES1)</A>.  These algorithms had been submitted by members of the cryptographic community from around the world.  At that conference and in a simultaneously published <A HREF="round1/aes_9809.htm">Federal Register notice</A>, NIST solicited public comments on the candidates.  A <A HREF="round1/conf2/aes2conf.htm">Second AES Candidate Conference (AES2)</A> was held in March 1999 to discuss the results of the analysis conducted by the global cryptographic community on the candidate algorithms.   The public comment period on the initial review of the algorithms closed on April 15, 1999.  Using the <A HREF="round1/pubcmnts.htm">analyses and comments received</A>, NIST selected five algorithms from the fifteen.
      <P> The AES <A HREF="round2/round2.htm#algorithms">finalist candidate algorithms</A> 
        were <B>MARS, RC6, Rijndael, Serpent, and Twofish</B>, and NIST developed 
        a <A HREF="round2/round2.htm#NIST">Round 1 Report</A> describing the selection 
        of the finalists.
      <P> These finalist algorithms received further analysis during a second, 
        more in-depth review period prior to the selection of the final algorithm(s) 
        for the AES FIPS. Until May 15, 2000, NIST solicited public comments on 
        the remaining algorithms. Comments and analysis were actively sought by 
        NIST on any aspect of the candidate algorithms, including, - but not limited 
        to, - the following topics: cryptanalysis, intellectual property, crosscutting 
        analyses of all of the AES finalists, overall recommendations and implementation 
        issues. An informal <A HREF="http://aes.nist.gov/aes/default.htm">AES 
        discussion forum</A> was also provided by NIST for interested parties 
        to discuss the AES finalists and relevant AES issues.
      <P> Near the end of Round 2, NIST sponsored the <A HREF="round2/conf3/aes3conf.htm">Third 
        AES Candidate Conference (AES3)</A> - an open, public forum for discussion 
        of the analyses of the AES finalists. AES3 was held April 13-14, 2000 
        in New York, NY, USA. Submitters of the AES finalists were invited to 
        attend and engage in discussions regarding comments on their algorithms. 
        The <A HREF="round2/conf3/aes3agenda.html">final agenda</A> for AES3 includes 
        links to the accepted papers, their presentations (if available), the 
        submitter statements, and the submitter presentations. All papers proposed 
        for AES3 were considered as <A HREF="round2/pubcmnts.htm">official Round 
        2 public comments</A>.
      <P>

After the close of the Round 2 public analysis period on May 15, 2000, NIST studied all available information in order to make a selection for the AES. On October 2, 2000, NIST announced that it has selected <B>Rijndael</B> to propose for the AES.  A <A HREF="/encryption/aes/round2/r2report.pdf">report</A>, <A HREF="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/g00-176.htm">press release</A>, and <A HREF="/encryption/aes/round2/aesfact.html">AES fact sheet</A> are available with that information.
      <P> After the announcement, NIST began preparing a draft Federal Information 
        Processing Standard (FIPS) for the AES, which was published for public 
        review and comment in February 2001. Following the 90-day comment period, 
        the draft standard will be revised by NIST, as appropriate, in response 
        to public comments. A review, approval, and promulgation process will 
        then follow. If all steps of the AES development process proceed as planned, 
        it is anticipated that the standard will be completed by the summer of 
        2001. At the time that NIST publishes the AES standard, it is intended 
        that validation testing (i.e., conformance testing) for AES implementations 
        will be available through NIST's <A HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/">Cryptographic 
        Module Validation Program</A>.
